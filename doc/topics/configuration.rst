=============================
Configuration file for Tryton
=============================

The configuration file controls some aspects of the behavior of Tryton.
The file uses a simple ini-file format. It consists of sections, led by a
`[section]` header and followed by `name = value` entries:

.. highlight:: ini

::

    [database]
    uri = postgresql://user:password@localhost/
    path = /var/lib/trytond

For more information see ConfigParser_.

.. _ConfigParser: http://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html

The default value of any option can be changed using environment variables
with names using this syntax: `TRYTOND_<SECTION>__<NAME>`.

Sections
========

This section describes the different main sections that may appear in a Tryton
configuration file, the purpose of each section, its possible keys, and their
possible values.
Some modules could request the usage of other sections for which the guideline
asks them to be named like their module.

~~~~~~

Defines the couple of host (or IP address) and port number separated by a colon
to listen on.

Default `localhost:8000`

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing>`_.

database
--------

Defines how the database is managed.

uri
~~~

Contains the URI to connect to the SQL database. The URI follows the RFC-3986_.
The typical form is:

    database://username:password@host:port/

Default: The value of the environment variable `TRYTOND_DATABASE_URI` or
`sqlite://` if not set.

The available databases are:

PostgreSQL
**********

`pyscopg2` supports two type of connections:

    - TCP/IP connection: `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/`
    - Unix domain connection: `postgresql://username:password@/`

SQLite
******

The only possible URI is: `sqlite://`

must have write access on this directory.

Default: The `db` folder under the user home directory running `trytond`.

Default: `True`

retry
~~~~~

table for translations.

Default: `en`

-----

Defines size of various cache.

model
~~~~~

The number of different model kept in the cache per transaction.

queue
-----

worker
~~~~~~

Activate asynchronous processing of the tasks. Otherwise they are performed at
the end of the requests.

Default: `False`

table
-----

This section allows to override the default generated table name for a
:class:`ModelSQL`. The main goal is to bypass limitation on the name length of
the database backend.
For example::

    [table]
    account.invoice.line = acc_inv_line
    account.invoice.tax = acc_inv_tax

ssl
---

and STARTTLS_.
The available protocols are:

    - `smtp`: simple SMTP
    - `smtp+tls`: SMTP with STARTTLS
    - `smtps`: SMTP with SSL

The uri accepts the following additional parameters:

* `local_hostname`: used as FQDN of the local host in the HELO/EHLO commands,
  if omited it will use the value of `socket.getfqdn()`.
* `timeout`: A number of seconds used as timeout for blocking operations. A
  `socket.timeout` will be raised when exceeded. If omited the default timeout
  will be used.
